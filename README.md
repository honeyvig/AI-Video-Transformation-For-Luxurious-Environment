# AI-Video-Transformation-For-Luxurious-Environment
I am looking for a skilled freelancer to transform a 15-second video of me and my friend into an AI-generated video that places us in a luxurious environment. The video is for a New Years Eve party we are hosting, and the video will played at the entrance for everyone to see when they arrive. The video will be provided and is designed to loop continuously throughout the night.

The idea is to transform us into a overly luxurious environment and setting. We’ll be clinking glasses of champagne together, then turning to the camera, raising our glasses. No sounds is needed.
---------------
To create an AI-generated video transformation, where you and your friend appear in a luxurious environment (for instance, a lavish party or an upscale mansion), you'll likely need to follow a series of steps to process the video and apply the desired effects. While full automation of such complex video transformation tasks requires advanced AI models and tools, I will guide you through the process using Python libraries and tools that can help achieve similar results.

Since video transformations involve image manipulation, machine learning models, and compositing, I'll break the process into the following steps:
Steps:

    Extract frames from the original video.
    Use AI models to insert you and your friend into a luxurious environment.
    Generate the video from the transformed frames.
    Ensure the video is loopable.

To automate this process, you'll need specific tools, including:

    Deep Learning Model for Background Replacement: A pre-trained model or tool to segment and place you and your friend in a new background. One potential option for background removal is DeepLabV3 (for segmentation), but for complete background replacement, you'd likely use a model like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Style Transfer models.
    Python Libraries: Libraries like opencv, ffmpeg, and moviepy for video editing.

Tools Required:

    DeepLabV3 (or another segmentation model) for background removal.
    StyleGAN or a similar model for AI-generated background insertion.
    moviepy or opencv for video manipulation.
    ffmpeg for video processing.

Python Code Outline:

import cv2
import numpy as np
import moviepy.editor as mpy
from PIL import Image
from tensorflow import keras
import os
import subprocess

# Load pre-trained model for background removal (DeepLabV3 for segmentation)
def load_model():
    model = keras.applications.MobileNetV2(input_shape=(None, None, 3), weights='imagenet')
    return model

# Function to segment and remove the background
def segment_and_remove_background(image, model):
    # Preprocess image for model
    image_resized = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))
    image_array = np.expand_dims(image_resized, axis=0) / 255.0
    prediction = model.predict(image_array)
    mask = prediction[0]  # Mask output
    
    # Create a binary mask (thresholding)
    mask = mask > 0.5
    
    # Apply mask to remove background
    masked_image = cv2.bitwise_and(image, image, mask=mask.astype(np.uint8))
    return masked_image, mask

# Function to replace background with a luxurious environment
def replace_background(original_frame, new_background_image, mask):
    # Resize background to match original frame
    background_resized = cv2.resize(new_background_image, (original_frame.shape[1], original_frame.shape[0]))
    
    # Replace background using the mask
    masked_background = cv2.bitwise_and(background_resized, background_resized, mask=mask)
    masked_foreground = cv2.bitwise_and(original_frame, original_frame, mask=cv2.bitwise_not(mask))
    
    # Combine foreground and background
    final_frame = cv2.add(masked_background, masked_foreground)
    return final_frame

# Function to process video frames
def process_video(input_video_path, new_background_image_path, output_video_path):
    # Load the AI model (e.g., for background removal)
    model = load_model()
    
    # Load the new background (luxurious setting)
    new_background_image = cv2.imread(new_background_image_path)
    
    # Open the input video file
    video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(input_video_path)
    
    # Get video properties
    fps = video_capture.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
    width = int(video_capture.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
    height = int(video_capture.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
    
    # Prepare for writing the output video
    fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
    video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter(output_video_path, fourcc, fps, (width, height))
    
    while True:
        ret, frame = video_capture.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        
        # Segment and remove the background
        masked_frame, mask = segment_and_remove_background(frame, model)
        
        # Replace the background with the luxurious environment
        final_frame = replace_background(masked_frame, new_background_image, mask)
        
        # Write the frame to the output video
        video_writer.write(final_frame)
    
    # Release resources
    video_capture.release()
    video_writer.release()

# Function to loop the video continuously
def loop_video(input_video_path, output_video_path, loop_count=10):
    input_video = mpy.VideoFileClip(input_video_path)
    final_clip = mpy.concatenate_videoclips([input_video] * loop_count, method="compose")
    final_clip.write_videofile(output_video_path, codec="libx264")

# Main function to process and loop the video
def main():
    # Set the input and output video paths
    input_video_path = "input_video.mp4"
    new_background_image_path = "luxurious_background.jpg"  # Replace with your background image path
    temp_video_path = "temp_video.mp4"
    output_video_path = "output_video.mp4"
    
    # Process the video (replace background with a luxurious environment)
    process_video(input_video_path, new_background_image_path, temp_video_path)
    
    # Loop the video continuously for the party entrance
    loop_video(temp_video_path, output_video_path, loop_count=50)

    # Clean up temporary file
    os.remove(temp_video_path)
    
    print("Video processing complete!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Detailed Explanation:

    Model Loading and Background Removal:
        We load a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNetV2) for image segmentation. This will help to remove the background from the original frames of the video.
        The function segment_and_remove_background() processes each video frame, removes the background, and prepares a mask.

    Background Replacement:
        The replace_background() function takes the background image (which is a luxurious setting you want to add, such as a fancy restaurant, mansion, or a lavish party) and replaces the background of the video frames using the generated mask.

    Video Processing:
        We open the input video, process each frame, remove the background, and replace it with the luxurious environment. The resulting frames are written into a new video file.

    Looping the Video:
        The loop_video() function uses moviepy to concatenate the processed video repeatedly, creating a looped video.

    Final Output:
        The final video is saved as output_video.mp4, which will loop continuously when played at the party entrance.

Prerequisites:

    Luxurious Background Image: You’ll need a high-quality image of the luxurious setting.
    Input Video: The original 15-second video.
    Python Libraries: You need opencv, moviepy, tensorflow, and others installed.

    pip install opencv-python moviepy tensorflow

Conclusion:

This code provides a basic framework to replace the background in your video and loop it continuously. The key steps involve segmenting the video frames, replacing the background with a luxurious setting, and then looping the video for display. If needed, you can also experiment with more advanced techniques or GAN-based models to generate ultra-realistic environments.
